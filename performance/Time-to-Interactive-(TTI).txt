Time to Interactive (TTI) is a web performance metric that measures how long it takes for a page to become fully interactive
 - meaning users can reliably interact with it without experiencing lag or delays.

A page is considered interactive when:

1. The page has displayed useful content (First Contentful Paint has occurred)
2. Event handlers are registered for most visible page elements
3. The page responds to user interactions within 50ms** - meaning the main thread isn't blocked by long-running JavaScript tasks

## Why TTI matters

TTI is crucial because a page might *look* loaded but still be unresponsive. For example, you might see buttons and forms, but clicking them does nothing because JavaScript is still executing in the background. This creates a frustrating user experience.

## What affects TTI

Common culprits for poor TTI include:
- Large JavaScript bundles that take time to parse and execute
- Long-running JavaScript tasks blocking the main thread
- Third-party scripts (ads, analytics, chat widgets)
- Unoptimized code or inefficient frameworks

## Good TTI benchmarks

- Good: Under 3.8 seconds
- Needs improvement: 3.8-7.3 seconds  
- Poor: Over 7.3 seconds

## How to improve TTI

- Code splitting to reduce initial JavaScript payload
- Deferring non-critical JavaScript
- Removing unused code
- Using web workers for heavy computations
- Optimizing third-party scripts

You can measure TTI using tools like Lighthouse (in Chrome DevTools), WebPageTest, or PageSpeed Insights. Note that TTI has been somewhat superseded by newer metrics like **Total Blocking Time (TBT)** and **Interaction to Next Paint (INP)** in modern performance monitoring.
