Here is a **Logic-Only Practice Questions List** for Machine Coding rounds.
No solutions, only questions – exactly what you asked.

You can paste this directly into Notion.

8. Convert an array of objects into a map/dictionary structure.
9. Flatten a nested array of any depth.
10. Chunk an array into smaller arrays of size `n`.
