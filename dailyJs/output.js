Letâ€™s break down this JavaScript code in detail, focusing on the event loop, microtasks, and macrotasks to understand why the output appears in a particular order.

Code Execution Breakdown

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("timeout 1");
}, 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log("promise 1");
});

Step 1: Understanding JavaScriptâ€™s Event Loop

JavaScript has an event loop that handles asynchronous operations. It divides tasks into two main queues:
	1.	Microtask Queue (Higher Priority)
	â€¢	Includes:
	â€¢	Promises (.then, .catch, .finally)
	â€¢	MutationObserver
	â€¢	Executed immediately after the main execution (synchronous code) and before macrotasks.
	2.	Macrotask Queue (Lower Priority)
	â€¢	Includes:
	â€¢	setTimeout
	â€¢	setInterval
	â€¢	setImmediate (Node.js)
	â€¢	I/O operations
	â€¢	Runs after the microtasks are completed.

Step 2: Execution of the Code

1. Initial Execution (Call Stack)
	â€¢	JavaScript starts executing the script synchronously, line by line.
	â€¢	The setTimeout function is encountered:
	â€¢	A timer is set with 0ms delay.
	â€¢	The callback function is registered in the macrotask queue.
	â€¢	The Promise.resolve().then(...) is encountered:
	â€¢	The .then() callback is added to the microtask queue.

2. Microtasks Execution (Higher Priority)
	â€¢	The main thread is now empty, so the event loop moves to the microtask queue.
	â€¢	The Promise.then callback executes immediately:

console.log("promise 1");

Output so far:

promise 1



3. Macrotasks Execution (Lower Priority)
	â€¢	Now, the event loop moves to the macrotask queue.
	â€¢	The setTimeout callback is executed:

console.log("timeout 1");

Final Output:

promise 1
timeout 1

Final Output Order

promise 1
timeout 1

Key Takeaways
	1.	Microtasks (Promise.then) always run before macrotasks (setTimeout).
	2.	Even though setTimeout has a 0ms delay, it is placed in the macrotask queue and will run after all microtasks are completed.
	3.	The event loop prioritizes microtasks before checking the macrotask queue.
